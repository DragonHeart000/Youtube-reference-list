# Youtube-reference-list

Hello, this is a fork of [Sages YouTube Reference List](https://github.com/SubSage/Youtube-reference-list). The idea of this fork is to add channels to the list faster than they were being added by sage and to catagorize channels so people who are here for a specific sub type of game design can find a recomended channel easily. Some channels may be shown in multiple catagories if they fall into more than one.

If you would like to have a channel added to this list please submit an issue on GitHub with the URL to the channel and what catagory of channel they are. I will get to it as soon as posible.

# General/all around

|Name & Link|Description|
|---|---|
|[**Extra Credits**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg) | This channel I do not recommend for anyone already invested, experienced, or familiar with game developemnt if your aim is to learn more. This channel is more catering to an audience who has no backing in game development, in the more recent work, material has been authoriative to the point that several people from gamedev communities (yours truly & Gamedev reddit comments) have questioned EC's credibility as a voice. That aside, still does provide interesting thoughts and is great for newcomers.|
|[**GDC**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0JB7TSe49lg56u6qH8y_MQ) | [Game development conference](http://www.gdconf.com/). This is THE conference for game developers to meet/showcase/showoff their works and projects. This channel will post a fraction of their conference videos on their youtube channel. You will find a plethora of post mortems, discussions, big name QA, workshops, etc. You can sign up on GDC's site to get access too all of their material. Watch this if you're at all serious about learning more of the scene of gamedev.|
|[**Raycevick**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1JTQBa5QxZCpXrFSkMxmPw) | Video essays on games. I can't provide a great description of Raycevick. If you have the time, give it a shot.|
