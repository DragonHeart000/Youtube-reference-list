# Youtube-refernce-list
Hi reader! This is Sage's (subsage.github.io) Curated list of youtube channels that I like to show to people interested in learning more about game development/design. You might end up not liking every single channel on here, but you should perhaps make a good effort to try and view each channel. Each channel here has a unique view/perspective on vide games from development to design that can be very helpful to all trying to make their own game. I'll try to update this list time to time as well as order it in some fashion, right now it's rather unordered. If you'd like to add to the list, please just contact me and let me know of a channel that you think could do well to this list. Please enjoy!

Folding Ideas: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyNtlmLB73-7gtlBz00XOQQ
Mostly focuses on design aspects of film, but I find that a good amount of what he speaks has some use in game design. He does play video games as well and can time to time help directly with game design.

Big name in gamedev for reviewing games.

Jim Sterling : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWCw2Sd7RlYJ2yuNVHDWNOA
A voice in game dev, somewhat more difficult to hear out time to time. Has opinions sometimes worth hearing on news within the field. I'd give him a pass if you're hard pressed for time.

Noah Caldwell-Gervais : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5CYeHPLer3lbEhgonvbbAA
Long form analysis (video essays) on games. Very, and I mean extremely comprehensive analysis/discussion on video games. A short video here is easily 45min+.

Can't really think of much for this channel, haven't seen a whole lot, but seems somewhat promising. Good source for seeing other games in the field.

Extra Credits : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg
This channel I do not recommend for anyone already invested, experienced, or familiar with game developemnt. This channel is more catering to an audience who has no backing in game development, in the more recent work, material has been authoriative to the point that several people from gamedev communities (yours truly & Gamedev reddit comments) have questioned EC's credibility as a voice.

Game References : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTxB1BeJYiNmuI1Nl2Tomgw
This channel show cases menus from various games. It's rather uknown. Great channel for referencing other games' UI decisions. It's only showcase, no explanations will be found here.

GDC : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0JB7TSe49lg56u6qH8y_MQ
Game development conference. This is THE conference for game developers to meet/showcase/showoff their works and projects. This channel will post a fraction of their conference videos on their youtube channel. You will find a plethora of post mortems, discussions, big name QA, workshops, etc. You can sign up on GDC's site to get access too all of their material. Watch this if you're at all serious about learning more of the scene of gamedev.

Handmade hero : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaTznQhurW5AaiYPbhEA-KA
A well known veteran of game development is creating a game from scratch and showing you every single line of code as well as explaining everything as he goes. He's making everything from scratch. All the code from the low level interaction to making the CPU interact with the GPU to the high level concepts/implementations of game mechanics.

Career Coach : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7DWn7tAAtT0SVQRqlJRknQ
