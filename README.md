# Youtube-reference-list

Hi reader! This is Sage's (https://subsage.github.io/) curated list of youtube channels that I like to show to people interested in learning more about game development/design/history/etc. You might end up not liking every single channel on here, but you should perhaps make a good effort to try and view each channel. Each channel here has a unique view/perspective on video games in different aspects that can be very helpful to all trying to make their own game or just be a little more informed on the medium as a whole. I'll try to update this list time to time as well as order it in some fashion, right now it's rather unordered. If you'd like to add to the list, please just contact me and let me know of a channel that you think could do well to this list. Please enjoy!

|Name & Link|Description|
|---|---|
|[**GDC**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0JB7TSe49lg56u6qH8y_MQ) | [Game development conference](http://www.gdconf.com/). This is THE conference for game developers to meet/showcase/showoff their works and projects. This channel will post a fraction of their conference videos on their youtube channel. You will find a plethora of post mortems, discussions, big name QA, workshops, etc. You can sign up on GDC's site to get access too all of their material. Watch this if you're at all serious about learning more of the scene of gamedev.|
|[**TotalBiscuit**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy1Ms_5qBTawC-k7PVjHXKQ) | [A well known reviewer for games.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TotalBiscuit) He has provided lots of great commentary on a plethora of indie games and runs a podcast.|
|[**Mark Brown**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqJ-Xo29CKyLTjn6z2XwYAw) | Documentary/analysis series on game design and development. Mark Brown, with his soothing voice, uncovers a wealth of information behind game-mechanics, design choices, and processes that lead games to be the way they are. Has a series called the [Game Maker's toolkit](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLc38fcMFcV_s7Lf6xbeRfWYRt7-Vmi_X9), a great series all around.|
|[**Ahoy**](https://www.youtube.com/user/XboxAhoy) | Documentary style overview of history of games and mechanics within games. Has amazing presentation skills and a great voice. If you miss watching documentaries, Ahoy is your person. Ahoy has covered histories of games and of tools that are often potrayed in games.|
|[**Raycevick**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1JTQBa5QxZCpXrFSkMxmPw) | Video essays on games. I can't provide a great description of Raycevick. If you have the time, give it a shot.|
|[**Errant Signal**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm4JnxTxtvItQecKUc4zRhQ) | Well worded video essays on games.|
|[**Super Bunnyhop**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWqr2tH3dPshNhPjV5h1xRw) | Well worded criticisms and reviews of games in general. [Has a site as well](http://superbunnyhop.com/)|
|[**Joseph Anderson**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyhnYIvIKK_--PiJXCMKxQQ) | Provides longform analysis and reviews that focus on gameplay from birdseye view.|
|[**Jim Sterling**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWCw2Sd7RlYJ2yuNVHDWNOA) | A voice in game dev, somewhat more difficult to hear out time to time. Has opinions sometimes worth hearing on news within the field. His reviews might not be very nuanced or technical, but he does a lot to uncover the muck in the industry. I would say he's a good source for news in the industry.|
|[**Noah Caldwell-Gervais**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5CYeHPLer3lbEhgonvbbAA) | Long form analysis (video essays) on games. Very, and I mean extremely comprehensive analysis/discussion on video games. A short video here is easily 45min+.|
|[**Folding Ideas**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyNtlmLB73-7gtlBz00XOQQ) | Mostly focuses on film, but a good amount of what he speaks has some use in game design, which he also does talk about. Folding Ideas plays video games as well and does speak well on them. He provides a great perspective from someone who has studied film much more than the typical gamedev.|
|[**Stop skeletons from fighting**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Xeb9-FhZXgvw340n7PsCQ) | Can't really think of much for this channel, haven't seen a whole lot, but seems somewhat promising. Good source for seeing other games in the field.|
|[**Writing on Games**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPlWv88ZRMxCcK3BGjrX7ew) | A channel that does in depth analysis of video games for mechanics he finds interesting. Provides good insight on several topics.|
|[**Game soup**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGPMrF9AN_D9BrmSmMeV3hA) | Analysis of video games.|
|[**snowman Gaming**](https://www.youtube.com/user/snomangaming) | Video essays on game design.|
|[**Game References**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTxB1BeJYiNmuI1Nl2Tomgw) | This channel show cases menus from various games. It's rather unknown. Great channel for referencing other games' UI decisions. It's only showcase, no explanations will be found here.|
|[**Handmade hero**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaTznQhurW5AaiYPbhEA-KA) | A well known veteran of game development is creating a game from scratch and showing you every single line of code as well as explaining everything as he goes. He's making everything from scratch. All the code from the low level interaction to making the CPU interact with the GPU to the high level concepts/implementations of game mechanics.|
|[**Career Coach**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7DWn7tAAtT0SVQRqlJRknQ) | Very friendly and motivation coach for people interested in game development. Has good advice all around.|

|[**Wituz**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXBPhjAqVt05H8Ph04u4jLg) | A cool dude who's providing a youtube series on how to program games for the play station 1, yes, you read that correctly, the PS1.|
|[**Extra Credits**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg) | This channel I do not recommend for anyone already invested, experienced, or familiar with game developemnt if your aim is to learn more. This channel is more catering to an audience who has no backing in game development, in the more recent work, material has been authoriative to the point that several people from gamedev communities (yours truly & Gamedev reddit comments) have questioned EC's credibility as a voice. That aside, still does provide interesting thoughts and is great for newcomers.|

Also, because...I want to praise myself some more, here are comments given on the list. Feel free to praise me to be added.

The channels below are currently on review, I've been suggested to add them here, but I have yet to see if they're channels that are overall helpful. As I give the thumbs up, I'll move them up with the table.
